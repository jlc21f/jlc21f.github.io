                <h3><br><b>User Experience Design #3</b><br></h3>
                    <p>For LIS4351, we were tasked to create a redesign for a photobooth for an application our professor used over a 
                    decade ago. It was a group of five, but the design and development was completely mine with feedback from 
            my group mates. If you want to run the demo, it is set up to allow you to choose 2 pictures, 2 emails, and 2 printed photos 
            with the FSU logo and Super Mario Galaxy as backgrounds and you can't enter any text. You can also just keep hitting continue 
            if you don't care to run the demo and want to just see what our design looks like.

                     I was given the games page and the drill practice page as well, but I helped with the design on all pages.
                      It is a bit hard to navigate at some points, but you can simulate a drill and look around all pages.</p>

                    <p>For Spring 2024, I took Research and Data Analysis in Information Technology, LIS3201, and was tasked to 
                    propose a product for a mock company. The product my group and I decided to do was an app for the mock company 
                    Health @ Home called the Health @ Home app. We decided to make an app that improves communication between 
                    patients and physicians who use Health @ Home. For this project, we had to do research on costs for app creation 
                    with the limited budget of Health @ Home and we had to present this app to our "stakeholders". </p>

                    changed the layout and color of the website to be more inviting to new users.</p>

                    <p>A 24-hour design sprint hosted by Gator User Design with the theme of the Healthier Future. 
                    In this submission, we decided to make a game where you need to make the best choices for Harmony Heights - 
                    a small town that has elected you as its mayor. We did not end up winning, but we had fun making this nonetheless.</p>

                    <p>In January 2024, my supervisor for University Housing hosted a sticker competition and the winner
                        would be considered for the sticker design that year. The requirement was one design
                        but I made 15 because I had so many ideas. This presentation is very informal! It was sort of a joke but most of 
                        the ideas were serious contenders that were made into stickers!</p>
